							<p>In this project, I wanted to connect Discord and Twitter, by combing the two APIs and seamlessly connecting them together. 
								So I set off to learn how to code using the discord API. My first project was very simple and it was the implementation of a queue. Using discord commands, you could easily join and leave the queue and I used it to keep track of who was playing AmongUs at the time.</p>
							<p>Since that went well, I continued my journey to creating a functioning Discord bot that would send the tweets of a user defined account to the corresponding user defined text channel.
								The main struggles came with creating a discord bot that was able to send messages on its own. Since the way that I had coded the other bot was defining commands as functions, I had to switch to using a class so that the bot could constantly update the correct servers whenever new tweets appeared.
							</p>
							<p>Overall, this project ended up being a good learning experience for me because I was able to see different ways of utilizing API as well as how I could use the API without straining it too much.</p>
